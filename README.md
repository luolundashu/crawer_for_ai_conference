"This is the first repository I've uploaded, and I'm very excited.

Motivation:
When trying to keep up with top AI conferences, extracting content based on keywords is highly inefficient. So, 
with the intention of creating a tool that allows input of conference names and keywords to automatically extract titles and package them, I wrote this repository.

For users in China, modifying the proxy settings can lead to faster downloads.

How to use:
To extract papers from cvpr, iccv, and wacv, run 'cv_get_paper.py'. You only need to modify the 'key_word_list' and 'conference_name_list'. 
This script scrapes the website: https://openaccess.thecvf.com.

To extract papers from iclr, NeurIPS, and icml, run 'ml_get_paper.py'. You will need to download the Chrome browser and the Chrome driver. 
Modify the 'driver' to the address of your Chrome driver. After that, you only need to modify the 'key_word_list' and 'conference_name_list'.
This script scrapes the website: https://openreview.net."
